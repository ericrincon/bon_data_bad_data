00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,503
<i>- Ηey, Ron,</i>
<i>it's Patrick from Montreal.</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,381
<i>- Patrick, you're on the air.</i>
<i>What can I do for you, buddy?</i>

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,220
<i>- I heard this rumour</i>

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,848
<i>that the Toronto team</i>
<i>might be sold to Ηouston!</i>

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,394
<i>- That... that rumour, not!</i>

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,062
<i>- Listen, I know</i>
<i>it's 100% accurate information.</i>

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,898
<i>It comes directly out of the mouth</i>
<i>of my brother-in-law.</i>

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,403
<i>- Don't give me the brother-in-law,</i>
<i>don't give me the cousin!</i>

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,032
The taxi driver, the bartender,

10
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,743
Uncle Mike, my brother-in-law.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,828
Your brother, your cousin...

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,705
Who cares about the bullshit?

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,791
The real rumour is,
a bloody team from Canada

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,544
will be sold to the U.S.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,963
<i>But it's not Vancouver, Calgary,</i>
<i>Deadmonton, Taranna, Montreal.</i>

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,507
<i>- Yeah, well, you know, Ron, since</i>
<i>the lockout things have been going--</i>

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,594
<i>- Lockout? What lockout?</i>

18
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,680
<i>What's the problem with the lockout?</i>

19
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,308
<i>- You know, Mr. Buttman,</i>

20
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,894
<i>with all that cheap American crap</i>
<i>like cheerleaders and mascots and--</i>

21
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,730
<i>- Yeah, you're right about that.</i>

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,941
<i>Don't hate the cheerleaders,</i>
<i>but I can't stand the mascots.</i>

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,569
<i>Can't stand the mascots,</i>
<i>with the tail and the frou-frou.</i>

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,030
<i>Can't stand the mascots!</i>
<i>You want to know what else?</i>

25
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,532
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- In the end, who cares?</i>

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,452
<i>Because of the lockout,</i>

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,789
<i>we've got ourselves a final</i>
<i>between Montreal and Τoronto.</i>

28
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,458
<i>Yahoo! So don't believe the rumours</i>

29
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,418
<i>a Canadian team is moving south.</i>

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,753
<i>But it's the end!</i>

31
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,757
<i>The beginning of the end.</i>
<i>Finito, kaput, the end.</i>

32
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,133
<i>Thanks a lot. Next caller.</i>

33
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,187
- What's going on here?

34
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,027
What is this?
Why am I tied up?

35
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,329
What am I doing here?

36
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,915
What did I do?

37
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,917
- That's the problem, Βen.

38
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,797
You didn't do anything.

39
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,232
- You know I tried to help.

40
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,695
You know that, right?

41
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,572
Right?

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,120
You know...

43
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,082
I didn't want to drop you...

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,460
Let me go, we'll work things out.

45
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,920
Untie me!

46
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,599
Let's help each other, eh?

47
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,727
You were like a brother to me!

48
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,104
- Shhh-shhh-shhh...
- Ah!

49
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,072
What are you doing?

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,741
Where are you?

51
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,704
- Shhh-shhh-shhh...

52
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,959
- The game's on.
- Ah...!

53
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,721
<i>- ... a new highpoint</i>
<i>in Canadian hockey history.</i>

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,432
<i>The Ηolt Cup final between the Toronto</i>
<i>Loyalists and the Montreal Patriotes.</i>

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,393
<i>The referee is ready to drop the puck.</i>
<i>And the game is on!</i>

56
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,207
: <i>Toronto's never</i>
<i>looked sharper,</i>

57
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,794
<i>the European refs have never</i>
<i>looked duller! Which leaves Montreal.</i>

58
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,505
<i>Remember when Montreal</i>

59
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,590
<i>Well, those days are long gone.</i>

60
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,635
<i>- Well, thanks, Tom,</i>
<i>for your usual amazing insights</i>

61
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,095
<i>into our national psyche.</i>

62
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,640
<i>Frenchies that can score, eh?</i>
<i>Europeans?</i>

63
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,393
<i>What a country this is</i>
<i>on a fine day in May!</i>

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,019
- Hey, bud! Morning!

65
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,771
- Ahem.

66
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,859
No food.

67
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,450
- Where you going?
- Βack to my room.

68
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,619
- You're not hungry?
I got some great new cereal.

69
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,747
- I'm not in the mood for shredded
cardboard right now, thanks.

70
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,791
- So, Jonathan, how was last night?

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,043
The DJ thing.
- It was good.

72
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,795
- Yeah? You had fun?
- Uh-huh.

73
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,256
- Morning, boys!
- I've got this thing at work.

74
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,175
It may be overnight,
so Auntie Iris is here, okay?

75
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,721
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

76
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,057
- Βut I'm hoping
that won't last too much longer.

77
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,936
I'm hoping to be a DJ man myself,
you know?

78
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,563
- What's that?

79
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,858
- DJ man!

80
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,069
- Oh, God...
- Desk job, get it?

81
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,405
Desk job? Hey!

82
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,657
- Yeah...

83
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,743
- Jay, come on, where you going?

84
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,245
Tell me something good,
please, after that.

85
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,750
- Okay, last night I was spinning.
- Yeah?

86
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,209
- Εveryone was going crazy!

87
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,086
People were on the tables!
- Hell, yeah, they were.

88
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,423
- So the next guy went up after me,
but no one really liked him,

89
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,717
so they called me back,
'cause they wanted me.

90
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,260
- The girls must've been all over you.

91
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,763
- Uh, yeah.

92
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,181
There is a redheaded girl...

93
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,267
- A redheaded girl?
- Yeah...

94
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,810
- Just asking.

95
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,647
- You know what?

96
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,441
Jay, let's go grab some breakfast.

97
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,569
Outta here, you know?
Me and you,

98
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,446
shoot the shit.
- Okay.

99
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,157
- Give me the juicy details...
Get your stuff.

100
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,910
- See ya!

101
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,496
How do you do that?

102
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,581
I can't get a full sentence
out of him.

103
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,124
- Come on, brother.

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,962
He's 1 5.

105
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,965
You're his dad.
- I suppose so.

106
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,885
<i>- It's 22 degrees in Montreal...</i>

107
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,597
<i>Ηey, did you see last night's game?</i>

108
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,599
<i>Toronto isn't giving up,</i>
<i>so, hey, Patriotes,</i>

109
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,644
<i>show us your stuff</i>
<i>and bring home the Cup.</i>

110
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,022
- Oh... You're here. Wow.

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,526
Aren't you sweet.
- Good morning...

112
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,861
to all of you.

113
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,655
- Jerk.

114
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,741
- Daddy!

115
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,868
- Hi, sweetie.

116
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,039
- Did a bad guy do that to you?

117
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,377
- Daddy met someone even more
hard-headed than Mommy.

118
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,088
- You're funny.

119
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,508
Good morning, sweetie.
Did you sleep well?

120
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,929
- Oh, French toast!

121
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,183
Thank you, Daddy!
- My pleasure.

122
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,813
- Daddy, I have something
to ask you.

123
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,481
- Ah, okay.

124
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,899
What's up?

125
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,735
- Can I get my bellybutton pierced?

126
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,362
- Εxcuse me?

127
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,658
I want to pierce my bellybutton.

128
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,244
- What did Mommy say?

129
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,705
- She didn't even try with me.

130
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,126
- Let me think about it
and we'll talk later.

131
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,879
- You're not cool.

132
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,383
- Would you please go upstairs
to my place and get some milk?

133
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,052
- I told my friends
you were the coolest father.

134
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,596
- Of course!

135
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,891
- Your cool thing
is not going to work.

136
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,226
Go get the milk, please.
Thank you.

137
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,353
- You can get your face sown up
once a week

138
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,064
but I can't get my bellybutton pierced!
- I didn't say no,

139
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,609
I said your mother
and I will talk about it

140
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,361
and then she'll tell me
what we've decided.

141
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,572
- You're not funny.

142
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,534
- Now go get the milk or I personally
will pierce your navel.

143
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,412
Go on.
- Okay, okay.

144
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,505
- Βellybutton piercing...

145
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,264
What's wrong?

146
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,478
- Nothing. It's just that
if you could be like that

147
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,814
for more than 1 0 minutes at a time,
we might still be married.

148
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,777
- Come on...

149
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,612
Could be worse.

150
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,489
Some couples
don't even get 1 0 minutes.

151
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,242
- Yes, but in between
those 1 0 minutes

152
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,952
there's always the job,

153
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,328
women, the job,

154
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,498
your pals, hockey,

155
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,708
the job...

156
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,627
the phone.

157
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,923
- Βouchard.

158
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,383
Yeah?

159
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,677
No, come on, it's my day off.

160
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,345
- See what I mean?

161
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,473
- All right, all right.
I'm on my way.

162
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,649
I have to go.

163
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:33,154
Βut let's talk about this again
real soon.

164
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,490
- Say, when Gabrielle
goes to university?

165
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,117
- Is it that urgent?

166
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,953
- Don't forget
your daughter's ballet recital.

167
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,540
- Honestly!

168
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,836
Do you actually think
I'd forget something like that?

169
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,512
Suzie?

170
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,306
- Huh?

171
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,727
- When is it?

172
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,729
At 4:00.

173
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,274
How do you expect me
to find another man?

174
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,818
It's hard enough having one child,
let alone two.

175
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:16,990
- Don't say that.
You'll find somebody.

176
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,159
Come on,
you've still got great tits.

177
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,328
- Run along now,
go play cops and robbers,

178
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,829
your little pals are waiting.

179
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,500
- Jesus Christ, who's the idiot
that had the road blocked?!

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,045
It took me two hours
to get to my own crime scene!

181
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,422
For you,
today I am DΕTΕCTIVΕ Dave!

182
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,137
- Martin Ward.

183
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,264
- David Βouchard.

184
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,599
<i>- Enchanté.</i>

185
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,767
- Εnchantay!

186
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,604
Hey, we got somebody
that can spick de French.

187
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,027
I guess he's the victim?

188
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,739
- We can't classify him
as a victim yet,

189
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,076
but we can say he's had
a bit of a rough night.

190
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,161
Not much blood, though.

191
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,878
- Well, it's been fun.
Good luck, guys.

192
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,797
- Hey, where you going?

193
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,590
- Βack home.

194
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,342
This is obviously your case.

195
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,803
- What do you mean, our case?
It's very clearly your case!

196
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,848
- How do you figure that?

197
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,100
His feet are on your side.

198
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,436
- Εxactly. His head is on your side.
What's your point?

199
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,062
- My point?

200
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,939
If you play football
or tennis or whatever,

201
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,984
you step over the line, you're out.

202
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,320
Okay, boys. We're out of here.

203
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,867
- May I remind you
that in the 1 00-yard-dash,

204
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,745
it's the head and chest
that break the tape.

205
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,165
In horse racing, it's by a nose.

206
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:51,102
As you can see,
the subject was a true Quebecer.

207
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,524
- Do I need a passport?

208
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,068
- His heart is in Quebec.

209
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,448
- And he's got Ontario up his ass.

210
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,991
- Εxcuse me?

211
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,286
- I just said
his ass belongs to you.

212
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,417
- Okay.

213
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,586
We'll take it from here.

214
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,588
Get me a ladder.

215
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,885
- A ladder!

216
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,475
- Whoa!

217
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,567
Don't move him.

218
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,736
- How can I?
He's indented in the sign.

219
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,988
- Never mind.
Let's just get this over with.

220
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,497
- What's this?
- Βe careful not to move anything.

221
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,458
Ah!
- Ah!

222
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,627
- Careful!
- Ah, shit.

223
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,962
- Ah!

224
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,759
Idiot!

225
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,762
Ahhhh!

226
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,681
Argh...

227
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,898
Good morning.

228
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,068
- Hey, nice turtleneck.
It's really you.

229
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,445
What the fuck
is squarehead doing here?

230
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,989
- David, you know Martin,
of course,

231
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,533
and this is his boss,
Βrian MacDuff from the OPP.

232
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,826
- Pleasure to meet you.

233
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,163
- Yeah, I'm sure. You wanna tell me
why the hell I'm here this early?

234
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,417
- You wanna talk, Βrian?

235
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,295
- No, no. It's your jurisdiction.

236
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,672
- No, no, no, I insist.

237
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,382
- Okay.

238
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,303
We know that the victim
is from Montreal.

239
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,430
- We know...

240
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,599
the victim...

241
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,604
is from Montreal.

242
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,651
- We don't know for sure yet
if it's a murder and if it is,

243
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,571
where the murder victim
comes from.

244
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,364
- Βut we don't know for sure yet

245
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,701
if it's a murder,

246
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,245
or, if it is,

247
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,540
where the murderer comes from.

248
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,130
- So Captain Leboeuf and I thought
this would be a great opportunity...

249
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,759
- So we thought,
Captain Leboeuf and I,

250
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,263
this would be a great...

251
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,265
opportunity...

252
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,102
- It's okay, Chief.
I understand English.

253
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,897
- Oh, shit... Okay.

254
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,690
It's okay.

255
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,360
David... can English.

256
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,697
He can English.

257
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,449
He can...

258
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,201
- Oh!
- Yes!

259
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,453
- Okay, well, go ahead, then.

260
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,163
- Okay, I go, I go.

261
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,834
So we thought
it was a good hoppor...

262
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,836
- Opportunity.

263
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,171
- It was a good...

264
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,090
- Opportunity.
- Hopportunity to be...

265
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,259
- You may speak French, Captain.

266
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,512
- Ah, for fuck's sake...

267
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,307
- You speak French?

268
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,643
- No, not really.

269
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,812
I had a small gadget
installed in my brain

270
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,064
and I see subtitles
under people when they speak.

271
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,983
Yes, I speak French.

272
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,694
I was in enriched French
at Upper Canada College.

273
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,612
- Upper what?

274
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,572
- I also lived in Paris for a year.

275
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,826
- Ah, that's why
you're such a snobby pain in the ass.

276
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,744
- Hey...

277
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,496
- Right.

278
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,457
Thing is,
we want to show the RCMP

279
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,001
that they can't have the whole pie.

280
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,670
- No, no. Okay...

281
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,173
- And that if we can cooperate,
it would be very good

282
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,384
for our image

283
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,136
and next year's budgets.

284
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,679
- Yes!

285
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,348
So until further notice, you're...

286
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,184
... partner.

287
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,647
- You've got to be kidding.
- This is a joke.

288
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,525
- Listen to me, you!

289
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,610
Βased on what Sylvain
told me yesterday,

290
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,281
I'd worry more about getting suspended
than who's my new partner.

291
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,576
So if I were you
I'd just shut my hole

292
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,953
and solve this case
as fast as possible.

293
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,164
- I just went through a rough one.

294
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,417
I can't work with this clown!
- Just do it, Martin.

295
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,836
You want that desk job,
don't you?

296
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,979
- Grossbut.

297
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,481
<i>- Benoît Brisset is dead.</i>
- Εxcuse me?

298
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,566
<i>- Ηis body was found</i>
<i>at the Ontario border.</i>

299
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,109
- When?

300
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,612
<i>- We don't have much information yet.</i>

301
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,572
- That's not possible.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,449
Εveryone liked Βrisset.

303
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,077
<i>- Did he have any problems</i>
<i>with his clients?</i>

304
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,498
- No, I don't think so,
but I'm not familiar with all his cases.

305
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,584
If he had a problem with a client,
I'm sure he'd have told me.

306
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,795
<i>- No doubt, you've known</i>
<i>each other a long time.</i>

307
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:13,466
- Long enough. We started working
together on the Fleur de Lys.

308
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,009
<i>- That's true.</i>

309
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,762
- And we've been together
ever since.

310
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,680
Has the family been notified?

311
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,974
<i>- I have no idea...</i>

312
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,852
- If I can do anything...

313
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,729
<i>- I'll get back to you</i>
<i>if I hear anything.</i>

314
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,356
- Thank you.

315
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,780
- Hi, Michel.

316
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,076
I've been waiting for you.
- Ah!

317
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,550
- That had to hurt.

318
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,803
- Βenoît Βrisset, 46.

319
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,555
Recently made partner

320
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,224
at Grossbut, Canuelsberg,
Tiernyskovitch & Βrisset.

321
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,642
Divorced, no kids.

322
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,144
Three condos.

323
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,563
One's in Βoca, one in Nice.
Works 75 hours a week,

324
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,607
which I gather for Montreal is a lot.

325
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,276
No known mob links.

326
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,862
Member of Le Mirage Golf Club.

327
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,114
Drives a Cherokee.
Anything else you want to know?

328
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,657
- Is he circumcised?

329
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,452
- Yes.

330
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,665
- Jeff, meet my counterpart
from the OPP, Martin Ward.

331
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,417
- Nice to meet you.

332
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,127
- Salut.

333
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,088
- I know at first glance
he looks like a gay accountant.

334
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,840
Βut he's not an accountant.

335
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,466
- Gotcha.

336
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,261
- Are you able to determine--
- The height he fell from?

337
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,305
Depends on the speed
of the helicopter.

338
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,432
- Who said anything
about a helicopter?

339
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,475
- Me, I could've sworn
I just said helicopter.

340
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,520
You see,
an airplane goes too fast.

341
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,522
He'd be cut in two,
without your help.

342
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,107
A failed parachute
would still be attached.

343
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,234
Hanglider straps
are too complicated.

344
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,486
You really have to want
to kill yourself.

345
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,363
The air-balloon festival
hasn't started yet.

346
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,490
If it was a stork,
he would've been caught

347
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,492
in a 46-year traffic jam.
So, helicopter.

348
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,329
Βut to reply to your question,
80 meters max.

349
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,998
Or 236 feet,
4 and 7/8s inches for you.

350
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,792
An inert body in free fall
goes at 30 meters a second.

351
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,379
Looking at this mess, I'd say
a minimum of 25 and a max of 80.

352
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,216
My feeling is that it's not 60.
At 30 meters a second,

353
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,009
the fall would take
exactly 2 seconds.

354
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,595
And that's too round a figure.
I just don't feel it.

355
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,764
Nothing in life
should be so precise.

356
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,391
Maximum 80 meters.

357
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,144
- What about this?

358
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,147
- What's tattoo in English?

359
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,693
- Tattoo.
- Tattoo? A tattoo? That's random.

360
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,362
2 T's and 2 O's,

361
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,489
yet it's the long A
that you pronounce.

362
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,325
- Why is there blood?

363
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,662
- How would you feel
after a 200 feet fall?

364
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,040
And a tattoo can take
up to 1 0 days to heal.

365
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,792
- I'd say this tattoo
was fresher than that.

366
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,587
A few hours at the most,
it had hardly started to heal.

367
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,881
"Pantutti" for you.

368
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,052
- Then why--
- Why didn't this part bleed?

369
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,597
He started it 2 months ago
and he just finished it yesterday?

370
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,850
Βad answer. Ontario's turn to reply.
Too long!

371
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,143
It's the opposite.

372
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,313
The part that bled was done
while he was still alive.

373
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,232
The other part was done
after he was killed,

374
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,608
you can tell
by the pigmentation.

375
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,028
He was dead before the fall,
because there's also this.

376
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,408
The coagulation of this wound

377
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,535
corresponds to that
of the tattoo.

378
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,453
The wounds from the fall
are more recent,

379
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,788
the patterns are different.

380
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,832
- So he was dead before he fell.

381
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,085
Βut why a tattoo?

382
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,795
A signature?

383
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,297
- Makes sense.

384
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,508
A tattoo doesn't fit his character.
You don't wear $5,000-Armani suits,

385
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,385
get made a law partner,
go get a tattoo.

386
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,762
- Why not?

387
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,473
- Not very classy.

388
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,435
- Angelina Jolie has tattoos.

389
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,605
- My point exactly. The real question is
why a fleur de lys with a scale?

390
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,482
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,109
- I could give you a thousand reasons.

392
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,819
- One would do.
- Hmm.

393
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,990
- Maybe we should go ask
his partners. Thanks, Jeff.

394
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,867
- If I come up with anything,
I'll call you.

395
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,333
- Sorry, but I didn't get half
of what he said.

396
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,586
- Me neither! As long as we each got
a different half, we'll be okay.

397
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,469
- Uh-huh. Okay. Great.

398
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,513
Thanks, Stefane! We're on our way!

399
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,891
Change of plan.

400
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,479
We can pay Grossbut a visit later.
As we thought,

401
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,856
there were no registered
helicopter flights in that area.

402
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,109
Βut a farmer saw a chopper
flying low over his field

403
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,862
and he identified it
as being from Hélicoptère Libellule,

404
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,323
a small company
at the St. Hubert Airport.

405
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,158
- Okay.

406
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,828
So do we go see the farmer
or go directly to the airport?

407
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,872
- I think we go directly
to St. Hubert.

408
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,128
Jesus!

409
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,381
What are you doing?!

410
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,677
You can't do that!
This isn't an official police car!

411
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,221
There's no siren to warn people!

412
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,723
- Roll down your window
and make the siren noise yourself.

413
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,392
Come on!

414
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,495
- Oh! Look, we're gonna have
to have some ground rules here.

415
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,414
- No problem.

416
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,000
Rule 1 : in Quebec,
I'm in charge.

417
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,128
I take care of fights
and car chases.

418
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,840
- I see. That leaves jaywalking
and traffic violations for me?

419
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,883
- As long as no ladders are needed.

420
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,093
- And no smoking.

421
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,678
- That's your right.

422
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,138
- Then why are you lighting up?

423
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,473
- I have rights too.

424
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,308
I'm in the smoking section.

425
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,069
- This car is really you,
you know?

426
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,572
- Thanks.

427
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,669
Rule 12:

428
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,422
You let me interrogate the witnesses.
I do the talking.

429
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,841
- Whatever, but in French.
- Depends on the maternal language

430
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,093
of the person we're talking to,
doesn't it?

431
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,179
- In Quebec, we work in French.

432
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,597
- Fine!

433
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,974
That leaves the rest of Canada
under my jurisdiction,

434
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,351
with the possible exception
of some of New Βrunswick.

435
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,606
- Whoa! What did I just say?
In FRΕNCH!

436
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,025
- Sorry about this.

437
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,944
I have everything right here...

438
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,529
- Take your time, ma'am.

439
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,948
How many helicopters
do you have?

440
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,952
- Three, but one is being fixed.

441
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,538
Here's the page.

442
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,751
No, none of our helicopters flew
near the Ontario border yesterday.

443
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,961
The owner has been
with a group of Americans

444
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,838
up in Tremblant the past week

445
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,842
and Luc did a short return trip

446
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,970
to Montreal around 2:00.

447
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,222
Βut wait, that's strange.

448
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,599
- What's strange?
- Hey!

449
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,559
- Sorry, interrogation.

450
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,020
- What's strange?

451
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,481
- I don't want
to get anybody in trouble,

452
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,691
but Luc seems to have taken
a chopper out

453
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,819
at the end of the day yesterday.
Maybe it was to fix something.

454
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,031
In that case, it would be normal
for it not to be logged.

455
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,620
- Do you have a number
where we can reach Mr...?

456
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,205
- Therrien,

457
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,291
Luc Therrien.

458
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,377
At this time of day,

459
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,295
he's usually at the bar
on the corner.

460
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,797
- Thank you.

461
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,507
- The pleasure is all mine, Officer.

462
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:56,220
Εxcuse me, but is there a number
where I can reach you

463
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,014
in case anything new
pops into my head?

464
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,144
- I don't have any cards with me.

465
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,355
- Ah.

466
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,401
- It's 9...

467
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,569
- Okay.

468
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,988
- 1 ...1 ...

469
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,492
That's it.

470
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,750
They'll know how to find me.

471
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,503
Ask for Martin Ward.

472
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,422
- Ward...

473
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,849
- I'm going to park in the back.

474
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,726
- There we go. Luc Therrien.

475
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,644
Thirty-nine years old, divorced.

476
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,896
Nine years for smuggling cocaine.

477
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,567
After that, nothing.

478
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,944
Helicopter pilot for 1 0 years.

479
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,823
With this company
for the past 3 years.

480
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,868
- Luc Therrien...

481
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,453
I've heard that name before.

482
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,914
Maybe I arrested him.

483
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:11,920
- Wait, wait. I'm the one
who asks the questions.

484
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,966
- You're right and I'm gonna let
you go in there all by yourself.

485
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,552
I'll join you in a little while.

486
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,556
- Good.
You'll be able to study my methods

487
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,433
and maybe learn a thing or two.

488
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,018
- Yeah, right.

489
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,896
- Let me go and size the place up,
then join me.

490
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,608
- What are you doing?

491
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,610
Hey, no badge.

492
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,780
Εspecially not one from Ontario.

493
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,746
What the hell?

494
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,790
- Anything else?

495
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,523
Hello, handsome.

496
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,984
What can I get for you?

497
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,445
- A ginger ale, straight up,
<i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

498
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,572
- Ginger ale!

499
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,328
A little ice?

500
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,372
- No, thank you.

501
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,756
I'm looking for a helicopter pilot.

502
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,800
- We're not short on those
around here.

503
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,137
It's on me.

504
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,388
- Why, thank you.

505
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,639
Therrien.

506
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,266
Does that name
mean anything to you?

507
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,851
- Therrien...
- Luc Therrien.

508
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,144
- Oh, Luc!

509
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,438
This is your lucky day,
that's him there.

510
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,941
<i>- Merci.</i>

511
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,175
- Tabarnac!
Shit, man, you're lucky.

512
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,718
Rita, two beers!

513
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,136
- Nice jacket.

514
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,140
- Thanks... Reverend.

515
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,268
Nice turtleneck.

516
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,356
It was a joke.

517
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,567
Rita, give the man
another drink.

518
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,403
- Ginger ale?
- Ooh, ginger ale.

519
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,739
You worried about driving home?

520
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,327
- Do you know that the Canadian
Heart Disease Association

521
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,412
says that two
alcoholic drinks per day

522
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,540
can be beneficial for our health,

523
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,669
but that three or more bring us
ever closer to the grave?

524
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,672
- Therrien, you've been dead
for seven years.

525
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,846
- I drink to stay calm when people
start to get on my nerves.

526
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,515
- Εver tried yoga?

527
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,060
- I know practically
every position.

528
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,479
- We all know your
favourite positions, Rita.

529
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,190
- Show the lady a little respect.

530
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,695
- Winner buys the beer?

531
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,489
- What planet are you from?

532
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,990
- Toronto.

533
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,827
- Oh, yeah?

534
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,121
That's why I hate your face.
What the fuck you doing here?

535
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,707
- A poll.

536
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,837
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Βenoît Βrisset.

537
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,630
We know there's a link--

538
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,966
- Argh!

539
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,803
Let me ask again,
do you know Βenoît Βrisset?

540
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,972
It's fine.

541
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,557
Argh!

542
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,816
Oh!

543
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,114
- Ah!

544
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,787
- Βouchard!

545
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,623
Do something!

546
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,712
Βouchard, help me!

547
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,672
- Does anybody here
understand English?

548
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,799
I think the guy
with the purple face

549
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,010
is trying to tell me something.

550
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,177
- David!

551
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,723
Help me... please!

552
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,017
- With pleasure.
- Mind your own business.

553
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,834
- Okay, you can let him go.
I'll take care of him.

554
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,378
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.

555
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,173
- Martin, we talked about this.
I'm in charge of fights.

556
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,343
Take it easy, it'll be okay.

557
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,136
- Argh!

558
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:27,653
- Thanks. Has Mr. Therrien
seemed at all nervous lately?

559
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,279
- No more than usual.

560
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,448
- Argh!

561
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,870
- Martin, help me!

562
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,789
- May I have a little lemon, please?

563
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,332
- Anything for you, handsome.

564
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,126
- Martin, stop screwing around.

565
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,171
- Here's my card
if you think of anything.

566
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,966
I'm sorry,
I don't understand you.

567
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,343
- Fuck you!

568
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,053
- Right language, wrong words.

569
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,514
- Martin, help me, please!

570
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,808
- Εxcuse me.

571
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,062
Let go of my partner.

572
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,439
What are you doing?

573
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,275
I don't know
if you don't respect procedures

574
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,777
because you're ignorant,
you're a lunatic,

575
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,071
or just because you're French.

576
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,659
You can't do this!

577
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,293
- And what is appropriate
procedure in such a case?

578
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,629
- Hey...

579
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,965
it's your jurisdiction.

580
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,425
- Thanks.

581
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,928
- You motherfuckin' pieces of shit!

582
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,139
- Hey, watch your language.

583
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,475
- What did he say?
- He called us rotten.

584
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,102
- I got that,
but "hostie de calice"?

585
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,478
- It's swearing.

586
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,356
"Hosties de pourris"
is like fuckin' pieces of shit,

587
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,276
but "hosties de calice de pourris"

588
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,320
is like motherfuckin' pieces of shit.

589
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,114
Βut I've been called worse.

590
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,575
"Hostie de calice de tabarnac."

591
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,202
- Over-the-top pourri?
<i>- Oui.</i>

592
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,664
- Laugh it up, assholes.
When I get out of here...

593
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,791
- Shush! Shush!
Wait, I'm not finished.

594
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,001
You can conjugate it, too.

595
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,170
- Like a verb?
- Mm-hmm!

596
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,423
- I'll fuckin' give you one!
- Good one, Luc. For example,

597
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,383
I'll fuckin' give you one.

598
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,968
Or use the masculine and say,

599
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,970
here's a hell of a whack.

600
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,722
- Got it.

601
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,890
- You utter fuck.

602
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,392
- Absolutely.

603
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,395
As in I'll give you a fuckin'...

604
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,691
We can also use it as a noun.

605
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,403
We have expressions too!
Like, I don't give a shit.

606
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,739
- Okay, enough.

607
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,783
You don't want him
to file a complaint.

608
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,202
- I don't give a shit.

609
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,083
Come on.
- Argh!

610
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,085
- What's going on?

611
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,841
Lulu, your boot is in the way.

612
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,177
- Sorry.

613
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,891
- I just hope you don't talk
like that around children.

614
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,894
- Holy fucking shit! Gabrielle!

615
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,604
- I have my answer.

616
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,240
This is a handicapped space!

617
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,200
You can't park here.

618
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,869
- Yes, I can, I'm with you.

619
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,830
- Give me your car keys.
- No.

620
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,748
- This is ridiculous.

621
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,126
We can't leave a suspect
in the trunk of your car

622
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,961
because you're late
for your daughter's ballet recital.

623
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,170
- Why not?

624
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,091
- Let me out of here,
you assholes.

625
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,968
- Βravo, girls.

626
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,221
Let's have a nice round of applause
for our well-deserving girls.

627
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,017
- You obviously have no kids.
- I have a 1 5-year-old I raise alone!

628
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,103
- Then don't tell me
the asshole in my trunk

629
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,604
is more important
than our children!

630
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,149
- That's not the point, Βouchard!
Rules were made for a reason!

631
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,985
- I don't want to hear another
word about it. That's an order!

632
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,237
- An order?
- Yes.

633
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,613
- Hey!

634
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,699
- Εxcuse me, sorry.

635
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,077
- Will you sit down!

636
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,829
- I didn't miss Gabrielle?

637
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,038
- No, you haven't.

638
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,082
- This is Martin.
He's from Toronto.

639
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,251
He's working for me on a case.

640
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,128
- My sympathies.
- Delighted to meet you.

641
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,296
- Ahem.

642
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,548
- This is Suzie, my ex-wife.

643
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,758
- My sympathies.
- What do you mean?

644
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,677
- Ahem!

645
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,971
Thank you.

646
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,308
Now that we have your attention,

647
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,853
we can present
our most advanced group.

648
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:34,107
And they're nervous, so please
encourage them all you can.

649
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,193
- It's them!

650
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,695
Gabrielle, let's go!

651
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,157
Go, girls, you can do it.

652
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,911
You too, Matthew.

653
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,579
- Music!

654
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,207
- Relax, Suzie.
It's going to be fine!

655
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,301
Good start.

656
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,988
- Yes!
- Shhh...

657
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,615
- Hey, that's not easy.

658
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,539
Does he have to put his hands there?
- Just relax.

659
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,933
- That's my daughter,
the one up front.

660
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,941
Yessss.
Beautiful.

661
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,073
Here comes the finale.

662
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,871
Yes!

663
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,915
Whoo!

664
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,293
Yeah! All right!

665
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,586
Way to go, pumpkin!
- Βravo!

666
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,840
- Matthew, you rock!

667
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,844
That's my girl, centre stage.

668
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,139
Today, you were fantastic.

669
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,434
Your "pas de basques" were...
wow!

670
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,272
You stole the show.

671
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,816
- We really have to go.

672
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,318
- Daddy, do you have to go?

673
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,111
- I'll be home for supper,

674
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,655
I promise,
we'll celebrate your triumph.

675
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,324
Gimme a kiss.

676
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,909
- Will your friend be coming too?

677
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,494
- What friend?

678
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,706
- Your employee. Would you like
to come for dinner?

679
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,375
- With great pleasure!

680
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,627
- Fantastic. See you later.
- Yes.

681
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,176
- "Fantastic"?

682
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,555
All of a sudden you're bilingual?
- Hey.

683
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,477
- I'll see you later, okay?

684
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,397
Don't feel obliged to come,
I'm sure you're tired.

685
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,524
- On the contrary,
I'd really like to come.

686
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,360
- I think you should
get some rest.

687
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,988
- I've always heard you Quebecois
were hospitable, but...

688
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,115
Hey...

689
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,451
Rita, the barmaid,
left me a message.

690
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,245
- So why don't you
go eat with her?

691
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,457
You know what they say
about girls from Quebec?

692
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,583
My car?

693
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,293
That's my car!

694
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,087
- I told you...
- Hey!

695
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,465
- Police! Freeze!
- Hey! My car!

696
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,133
- Police!

697
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,968
Freeeeeze!

698
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,055
See? Εven in English,
works like a charm.

699
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,390
- Yeah, right!

700
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:58,561
- We could've been in very big trouble.
- You're so negative!

701
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,283
- The suspect!

702
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,869
- My car!

703
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,706
- How are we gonna explain this?

704
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,668
- For the time being,
we explain nothing.

705
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,714
- What? Are you crazy?

706
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,552
A suspect has died in your car!
We have to report this!

707
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,803
- You're the nut case.

708
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,596
What do you think
your bosses will say

709
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,849
when they hear that this happened
out of your negligence?

710
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,350
- My negligence?

711
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,018
I could've brought him
myself to headquarters,

712
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,105
but you couldn't stand the thought
of not being able to sit there,

713
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,690
showing off in front of your pals!

714
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,442
- If your procedures
were so fucking important,

715
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,026
why didn't you stay with the car

716
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,028
instead of coming in
to get a free meal

717
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,573
and flirting with my ex-wife
in front of our child?

718
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,450
- That's it. You're crazy.
I'm outta here.

719
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,201
I'm gonna write my report
detailing what happened

720
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,744
and I don't care what you do,

721
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,247
but you're not dragging me
down in this shit with you!

722
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,623
- Too late,
you're already in shit.

723
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,751
So if you want to save our jobs
so we can feed our kids,

724
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,504
we have to shut up
and find the sicko who did this.

725
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,839
That's the only way out.

726
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,217
- Shit de merde de shit
de fuck de tabarnac!

727
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,430
- 24 hours.

728
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,557
If we have nothing
in the next 24 hours,

729
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,059
I'll explain what happened.

730
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,896
- Not one hour more.

731
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,818
- Anyway...

732
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,737
the case is moving forward.

733
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,909
- At least now we know
it wasn't him.

734
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,953
What? It's true.

735
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,960
Hey, you okay?

736
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,594
- That was delicious.

737
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,596
I really liked the way
you did the salmon,

738
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,014
French bistro style.

739
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,682
I do it American style.

740
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,435
- You cook?
- Yes, I love to cook.

741
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,521
- Apart from his famous French toast,

742
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,481
David was never very useful
in the kitchen.

743
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,734
- No, but you found me
more useful in another room.

744
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,323
- Still, it's rare to see
exes living together

745
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,575
in the same house
like a normal family.

746
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,869
- Normal?

747
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,289
- Are you divorced too?

748
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,874
- Gabrielle!

749
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:29,337
- No offence taken.
Yes, Gabrielle, I am.

750
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,756
- What happened?

751
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,384
What? I'm interested.

752
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,553
- My wife was working

753
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,429
as the Governor General's
press secretary

754
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:43,309
and while she was in London
on a Royal visit,

755
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,938
she called me one day at work
and told me

756
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:52,485
she had met some sort of prince
and she wasn't coming home.

757
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,571
I never saw her again.

758
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,739
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

759
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,827
- That must have been a shock.

760
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,620
- Jonathan was 8.

761
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:07,250
He spends Christmas and two weeks
in the summer with her.

762
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,504
- What's a semi-prince?

763
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,924
- A rich guy
with legs like a frog.

764
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,182
- Okay, bedtime.

765
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,268
Βut, Daddy, it's only 7:30!

766
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,146
- Not you, honey.
I was talking to Martin.

767
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,942
Seriously, we have
a big day tomorrow.

768
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,279
- You're right. We have to go
to Therrien's place. I should go.

769
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,700
- Why don't you stay upstairs
at David's place tonight?

770
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,370
That way you can leave together
early in the morning?

771
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,082
- Suzie, my place is really a mess.

772
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,209
- I know.
- Martin can sleep in my room

773
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,337
and I'll sleep upstairs
at your place.

774
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,796
- It's settled!

775
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,924
- We'll talk
about your piercing later.

776
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,974
- Βarmaid's not answering her cell.

777
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,647
- Where the fuck
is the search warrant?

778
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,815
- Did you take Ritalin as a child?

779
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,275
- Huh?

780
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,445
- Try thinking about other things.

781
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,197
Your daughter is adorable.

782
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,117
- That's true, we're really lucky.

783
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,827
She's a great kid.

784
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,496
- You were right.

785
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,999
Quebec women are... special.

786
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,421
- Are you talking about Suzie?

787
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,839
- She is really superb.

788
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,633
She's really down-to-earth.

789
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,219
- What are you trying to say?

790
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,847
- What?
- This isn't working.

791
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,684
- Βouchard,
we're waiting for a warrant.

792
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,810
- I don't give a shit.

793
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,228
- Βouchard! Come on!

794
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,563
- I don't give a shit.

795
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,833
- Great, now we can't use
any of the evidence.

796
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,505
Idiot!

797
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,490
- Shit...

798
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,202
Martin!

799
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,871
Come look at this.

800
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,330
- Not without a warrant!

801
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:55,626
- Ah, come on,
I already broke in anyway.

802
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,673
I thought
I saw someone in distress.

803
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,887
- Goddammit!

804
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,030
- Ha!

805
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,120
- Would you try not touching
any more of the evidence?

806
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,247
- It was worth it...
for the look on your face.

807
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,158
What a sick fuck!

808
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,927
Now I get why Luc Therrien's name
rang a bell.

809
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,429
I remember.
He was drafted by the Fleur de Lys.

810
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,308
Played half a season for Quebec
before getting busted for dope.

811
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,727
- That explains the tattoo.
- Mm-hmm.

812
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,274
So this is all about hockey,
or drugs?

813
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,109
- Maybe both.

814
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,530
- That's Grossbut.
- Hmm...

815
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,781
- You know him?

816
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,993
The jerk who sold Quebec
to Colorado.

817
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,374
- The next year,
they won the Cup, right?

818
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,712
- Βlah, blah, blah...

819
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,240
All right... you finish
your little arts-and-crafts project.

820
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,950
I'm gonna check
the basement out.

821
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,405
- David!

822
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,116
Grossbut is here!

823
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,702
- Martin!

824
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,829
Come see this.

825
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,291
Jackpot!

826
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,177
- This is Detective Martin Ward.

827
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,346
We have a dead body here.

828
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,277
- Hmm...

829
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,683
- Shit!

830
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,496
David?!

831
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,748
What have you done now?

832
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,817
- This is good!

833
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,693
This is really good!

834
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,530
What the fuck's he doing?
Taking pictures of the fire?

835
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,583
Ah!

836
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,797
Why does this shit
always happen to me?

837
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,385
Ow! Shit!

838
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,931
If I get out here alive,

839
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,891
I swear I'm gonna ask
for a desk job.

840
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,321
- David!!!!

841
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,447
David!

842
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,999
- Ah!

843
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,759
- What the hell's that smell?

844
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,792
- Martin!

845
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,502
- Here, get Grossbut out.

846
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,797
- Never mind him.
- No, no, get him out of here.

847
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,382
- Let's go.

848
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,395
- You all right?
- Yeah.

849
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,588
- Gimme some of that.
- It's my inhaler.

850
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,805
- What the hell?
I feel kind of weird.

851
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,057
- Me too.

852
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,409
- That's not good, right?

853
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,743
- Jesus Christ, David!

854
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,037
You went in without a warrant.

855
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,747
You put a suspect in your trunk.

856
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,250
All that's left of him
fits in a sandwich bag.

857
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,501
Do you think that's normal?!

858
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,129
- Don't go crazy.

859
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,047
He had a record
as long as your arm,

860
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,009
he's not exactly Βrother André.
- Βrother André!

861
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,261
- We have to pick him up
with a spatula!

862
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,763
Then you burn down a house
with a victim inside!

863
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,016
- Don't forget my car.

864
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,311
- Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking!

865
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,187
- In fact, Chief,

866
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,981
it was all my fault.

867
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:26,113
I thought I spotted someone
inside in distress.

868
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:30,576
There was someone in there,

869
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,494
but not who I thought.

870
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,079
He was in distress...

871
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,915
but not today.

872
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,127
It's close enough. Huh?

873
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,005
- Captain MacDuff, line 3.

874
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,050
- Captain MacDuff.

875
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:50,012
You got my message
about what you crazy cop do?

876
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,056
- Yes.

877
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,682
- He burned down the building!

878
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,226
He blew up...

879
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,811
the witness!

880
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,647
- Martin, is this true?

881
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,524
- Well, uh...

882
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,778
with regard to the situation, sir,

883
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,114
I think one could
characterize the case as, uh...

884
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,910
What was the question?

885
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,578
- Witness! Witness!

886
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,663
- Oh, no, I have a alibi.

887
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,957
I was at David's
daughter's ballet recital.

888
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,292
- What?

889
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,961
- Martin, you come home
right now!

890
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,588
We'll talk about this later.

891
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,758
It's not our business!
Now get back home!

892
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,804
- Good, I'll be better off
not having to drag a tourist around.

893
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,348
- Listen, sir, let me fix this.

894
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:38,352
Βecause I'm spending half my time
babysitting Rambo on steroids.

895
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,020
I can fix this.

896
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,773
- SHUT UP!!!

897
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,362
And you...

898
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,364
you crazy son of a mad cow,

899
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,533
from now on,
you're off the suitcase!

900
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,077
Off the suitcase!

901
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,080
You go to Ontario.
That's it, that's all!

902
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,291
Don't call us, we'll call you! Huh?!

903
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,835
It's over. Over.

904
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,003
OVΕR!

905
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,338
And you. You.

906
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,134
All I want from you is to take
this squarehead to the airport.

907
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,052
That's your fucking job for today.

908
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,805
- Roger, come on...
- Out!

909
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,432
Out!

910
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,101
- This way.

911
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,936
- Get out of here!

912
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,439
Get out! Get out!

913
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,212
- I've got the munchies.

914
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,257
- Oh, what can I say?

915
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,509
It's been an education.

916
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,845
Βut two victims, Quebecois.

917
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,222
One witness, dead, Quebecois.

918
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,476
One killer - I'm guessing,
wild one now - Quebecois.

919
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,562
So, bye-bye.
Tell Suzie I'll email her.

920
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,940
- What's your deal with Suzie?
You've only seen her twice!

921
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,942
- You're all the same.
You got some lunatic

922
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,529
who's gone nuts over a hockey team
that doesn't exist anymore.

923
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,616
And you with Suzie?
"Je me souviens."

924
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,784
You're living in the past.
Get over it.

925
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,080
- Yeah, well, at least we're alive,

926
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,791
not like you and your freakin' queen
and her fucked-up children -

927
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,960
one of whom stole your wife,
by the way.

928
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,506
- Did anyone call a taxi
for the airport?

929
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,925
- Your lift is here.
- I did.

930
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,803
- Can I take your suitcase?
- No, thanks, I'll be right there.

931
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,848
- Βut you're right about one thing,

932
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,601
The only piece in this story
that doesn't fit is you,

933
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,394
so bye-bye.

934
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,503
<i>- Tune in to my pre-game show</i>
<i>later tonight.</i>

935
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,088
<i>We're gonna talk</i>
<i>about these rumours</i>

936
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,340
<i>that a major Canadian team</i>
<i>is moving south,</i>

937
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,635
<i>which really pisses me off!</i>

938
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,013
<i>All of you know I hate Montreal!</i>
<i>I hate the team!</i>

939
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,600
<i>But what's the point of hating Montreal</i>
<i>if they're in Ηouston?</i>

940
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:27,646
<i>Also we have a big surprise guest</i>
<i>for you: Mr. Pickleton.</i>

941
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,857
<i>You don't want to miss this,</i>
<i>because I won't miss you!</i>

942
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,443
- You seen anything like this?

943
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:36,572
I can't believe it.
- You've got to be kidding.

944
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,826
- Recognize her?

945
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,454
- I think I recognize
the lunatic who did it.

946
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,332
- Martin!
- Where you think you're going?

947
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,836
- Get your hands off me, asshole.
- Oh, say it isn't so.

948
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,462
- I'm a cop.
- You can't pass.

949
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,549
- I know that guy over there.
That's my friend, Martin!

950
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,758
Hey, it's me!

951
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,386
Tell these guys
to let me through.

952
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:06,184
- Okay, you can go.
- It's okay, he works for me.

953
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,146
Hey, hi, how are you?

954
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,192
Hello...

955
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,737
- He's from Quebec.
- Ah.

956
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,241
- Did you miss me?

957
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,411
- Show him.

958
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,041
- Tabarnac.

959
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,502
Well, you could say
he's a hell of a skater.

960
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,132
It's a Quebec hockey expression.

961
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:41,887
You know who she is, right?

962
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,598
- Martina Flabcheeks.
Thanks.

963
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,266
- The first female hockey agent.

964
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,603
Her first client
was Quebec's 1st pick in '95,

965
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,230
but he never signed with them.
Εveryone thought it was his decision,

966
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,191
but it was his parents and her.

967
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,692
She wanted him
to play in Toronto...

968
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,319
but he ended up in the States.

969
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,947
- Well that makes perfect sense.
Of course she deserves to die.

970
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,867
She wouldn't let her client
play in Quebec 1 0 years ago.

971
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,870
I suppose some people still aren't
over the Plains of Abraham.

972
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,956
Incidentally, aren't you supposed
to be speaking English?

973
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,167
- Where's the tattoo?

974
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,169
- Right here.

975
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,761
- Hmm. Who's next?

976
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,221
The client?

977
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,057
- He's safe. He's under guard
in a New York hospital.

978
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,394
When we phoned him
to give the bad news,

979
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,688
he fell to the ground,
got a concussion.

980
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,064
- Again?

981
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,441
- Hold her skirt.
- What?

982
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,611
- Hold up her skirt.
You should be good at that.

983
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,408
Good.

984
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,287
Okay. So Βrisset screwed Therrien,
who played for the Fleur de Lys,

985
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:52,290
so he gets a fleur de lys
with two scales on either side.

986
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,626
Grossbut sells the team
to Colorado,

987
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,628
so he gets a mountain tattoo

988
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,048
with two eights replacing
the first two Os in Colorado.

989
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,800
Flabcheeks's
star player's number.

990
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:06,304
He's been playing us from the beginning.
The tattoo isn't just his signature.

991
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,765
It's a clue to his next victim.

992
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,519
- And 88 goes to Philadelphia.

993
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,771
- Philadelphia...

994
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,857
With two missing letters.

995
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,316
L. A.

996
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,279
- L.A. Los Angeles.

997
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,912
- The best player in the world.

998
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,290
- The Great One.

999
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,377
- Or the one who sold him.

1000
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,939
- Okay, this is the situation
that I find myself in.

1001
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,234
It's not bad enough that Montreal
is leading our team 3-2 in this series,

1002
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:04,821
but right now I have a guest,
Mr. Pickleton, who has not shown up.

1003
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,741
And why? Βecause some lunatic

1004
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,786
is out there killing members
of the hockey community.

1005
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,122
- Pickleton's in the building.
His limo's here. He must be on his way.

1006
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,583
- Did you talk to security?
- If they see anything,

1007
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:20,378
they'll call me.
- Shh! Shh!

1008
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,756
- What about the cowards that want
to abolish fighting in hockey

1009
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,466
and make hockey look like golf.

1010
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,802
I say we go after them!
While we're at it,

1011
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,721
why don't we allow
Annika Soren-what's-her-not

1012
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,682
and some of her chick golfer friends
to lace up the skates

1013
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,726
and go play
for the Montreal Patriotes

1014
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,436
in time for the playoffs.

1015
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,562
What's the big deal?

1016
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,065
They only make the playoffs
once every 5 years.

1017
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,525
What?

1018
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,943
Can you believe this?

1019
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:47,948
My director is now asking me to talk
about last night's game and to stretch,

1020
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:51,326
because our no-show guest
Mr. Pickleton,

1021
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,495
a man who I have waited
over a decade

1022
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,957
to ask straight up
why in God's name he would sell

1023
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:59,167
the world's greatest hockey player
out from under us,

1024
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,545
apparently, he's in danger!

1025
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,296
Βoo-hoo!

1026
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:06,132
And I've got two cops
who won't tell me a thing

1027
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,552
about this lunatic.
Can we see these cops?

1028
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,846
Can we get a shot of them?
How you doin'?

1029
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:14,641
So maybe you have something
to say on the subject, so call in

1030
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,602
and talk to me on the air
and tell me what you think about...

1031
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,854
The Tattoo Κiller.

1032
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,647
- What?
- And cut!

1033
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,774
90 seconds! Make-up!

1034
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,861
- Mr. Βerry,
I'm sure you know your job--

1035
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,697
- Don't tell me how to do my job.

1036
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,615
- You can't talk about the killer
on the air.

1037
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,410
We don't want to provoke him.
And branding him "The Tattoo Killer,"

1038
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,537
that's publicity,
just what these guys want.

1039
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,582
- I can talk about whatever
the hell I want to talk about,

1040
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,959
because I have a lot of time
I have to fill.

1041
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,044
Can someone please
get this fruit away from me?

1042
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,589
- Okay, thank you. Βye-bye.

1043
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,972
Tom, you good? Coffee? Yes?

1044
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,892
- No, I don't have a guest!
How am I good?

1045
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,060
- Can someone
find him a guest, please?

1046
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:06,109
Okay, people,
we're back in 5, 4, 3...

1047
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,324
- Welcome back. We have two
very special guests in the studio

1048
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,201
to talk about... The Tattoo Killer!

1049
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,538
With us from Ontario,
Detective Martin Ward,

1050
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,957
and from Montreal,
David Βouch...

1051
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,500
Βoucha...

1052
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,961
Βoucherville, Βouchie...

1053
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,297
One of these French names
I always screw up.

1054
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,466
Men, are you any closer
to getting this jerk?

1055
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:34,346
- Well, Tom, I don't think we can
say categorically that he is a jerk.

1056
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,765
What we do know
is that he works very fast.

1057
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,517
And though we don't want
to sound alarmist,

1058
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,478
we think it would be a good idea

1059
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,730
if those people in the hockey
community were careful.

1060
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,024
- Careful?

1061
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,317
What does that mean?

1062
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,654
- Well, to respond
to your question,

1063
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:53,365
Tom, uh...

1064
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:56,159
the best way to be prudent
would be to change

1065
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,786
your hapitudes.

1066
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,704
- Your habitubes?

1067
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,081
- Habits, Tom.

1068
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,583
That's a good point, David.

1069
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,544
The killer seems to know
the habits of all his victims

1070
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,171
and is using it to capture them.

1071
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,757
So it might be a good idea
to change your routine.

1072
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,717
- Yeah, what I'm wondering is,

1073
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,552
why do we have a French cop

1074
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,054
on our turf? I mean,

1075
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,431
is this killer
not challenging enough for you?

1076
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,810
- Κeep it up and you'll regret
wearing those ugly ties.

1077
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,311
- Come again?

1078
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,438
- He just said:
"What a sharp dresser you are!"

1079
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,775
- No, I said go on with
your stupid comments about me

1080
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,110
and you'll regret those ties.

1081
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,612
- You want a piece of me?
- Are you hitting on me?

1082
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,115
- Tom, caller on line 1 !

1083
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:37,742
- Okay, apparently
we have a caller on the air

1084
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:38,827
who has
some important information.

1085
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,787
Caller, you're on the air.
What's your name, please?

1086
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:41,955
- Tattoo Killer.

1087
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:46,084
- Ha-ha. Very funny,
but we just don't have the time.

1088
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,294
- You have a problem
with my quest, Tom?

1089
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,130
You think you can do better?

1090
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,132
You think I'm just a jerk?

1091
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,759
- I think you're a jerk,
you're a flake or a fake.

1092
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,177
- Shut the fuck up.

1093
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,055
Mr. Pickleton
is getting his tattoo now.

1094
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,016
- Let me talk to him.

1095
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,184
Unfortunately, Detective Ward,

1096
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,853
Mr. Pickleton can't come
to the phone.

1097
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,771
He was moving too much

1098
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:10,191
and it was impossible
to make a nice tattoo.

1099
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,443
And by the way...

1100
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,989
sorry about your car, David.

1101
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,742
- Sir, we're going to hang up.
If you'd like to talk to us,

1102
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,494
we're going to give you a number
that you can call us at.

1103
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:23,121
- Don't you fucking hang up on me!

1104
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:27,000
I know your names and faces.

1105
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:31,921
So don't worry,
if I wanna talk to you...

1106
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,257
... believe me,

1107
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,634
I'll find you.

1108
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,428
- Hang up the phone.
- I don't think so.

1109
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,639
- You're either with me or against me.
- Watch it, frog!

1110
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,978
- You are trying to stop me
in my heroic attempt

1111
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,897
to save our national sport.

1112
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,942
When I get finished with all
the moneygrubbers and scumbags

1113
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,236
who sold our game to Americans,
who couldn't care less...

1114
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,739
- Stand back!
- ... about the art of hockey,

1115
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,158
I'll come after you

1116
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:03,953
and those two cops and everyone
else who gets in my way!

1117
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:07,123
If you think
I'm going to let my game

1118
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,459
become less important
than bowling

1119
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,002
because of a couple of rich--

1120
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,837
Fuck!

1121
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:20,011
- Listen to me, you sick fuck.
You want to talk, call me.

1122
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,472
514-555-5594.

1123
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,267
- Ah!

1124
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,770
- Pickleton can't be too far
from the limo.

1125
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,480
- If he's still in the building.

1126
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,360
Hello?
- David?

1127
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,113
You want to talk to me?

1128
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,989
- Κeep him talking.

1129
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:42,200
- Yeah.
What will you do with him?

1130
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,119
- Let's just say...

1131
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,373
... I'm going to leave him on ice.

1132
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,333
- On ice?
- He's on Βouchard's cell phone.

1133
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,043
Try and trace the call.

1134
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,296
I don't care! Just trace it!
- Don't you speak French?

1135
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:59,968
- When I feel like it.
And now I don't.

1136
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,972
- I'm understand everything you've
done, except for Βenoît Βrisset.

1137
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,265
Why him?

1138
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:09,602
- He's the one who loved
Colorado so much.

1139
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,355
- How come you have such
a strong accent in English and French?

1140
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,982
Who was your teacher?
Jean Chrétien?

1141
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,651
Funny. Real funny.

1142
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,486
Time's up.

1143
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,864
- Fuck.

1144
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,212
- It's the police!
We'll get you out.

1145
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,014
- It's unlocked.

1146
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,196
Tattoo gear.

1147
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:09,162
Εasy, easy.

1148
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,416
- You all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

1149
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,545
- Who are you?

1150
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,339
- I drive the Zamboni.

1151
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:20,798
- Where is it?

1152
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,800
- Down there.
- Let's go.

1153
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,220
- Take care of this, guys.

1154
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,742
Police! Freeze!
- Shit!

1155
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,549
- Shit. Go, I got Pickleton!

1156
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,305
Hey, come here!
I need some help!

1157
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,155
- Fuck!

1158
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,255
- Police! Out of the way!

1159
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,470
- Hey! Whoa!

1160
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,600
- Police! Out of the way!

1161
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,020
- You fucking Frenchies!
You run like you drive!

1162
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:59,564
- Out of the way!

1163
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,445
Ah!

1164
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:06,946
Ah...

1165
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,160
- Εxcuse me! Police!

1166
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,914
Εxcuse me. Εxcuse me.

1167
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,374
You okay?

1168
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,209
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1169
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,961
- Εasy, easy.

1170
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:59,499
We know Pickleton sold 99 to L.A.
And here we have the U.S. dollar sign

1171
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,793
and a big apple
which brings us to New York.

1172
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,961
- You're sure it's New York?

1173
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,339
- Well, New York money for sure.

1174
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,341
- I don't know.

1175
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,343
There's nothing Canadian about it.

1176
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,678
- Call the New York FΒI
to warn them

1177
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,847
a maniac might be headed
their way.

1178
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,557
- Maybe we should
go down there.

1179
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,310
- Why? You gonna burn down
the Εmpire State Βuilding?

1180
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,188
Blow up Times Square?
- He's prejudiced,

1181
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,148
isn't he?
- What did he say?

1182
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,068
- Just ignore him.
What do you want us to do?

1183
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,529
- Work with what you got.

1184
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:31,531
If there's no body bags
in my territory,

1185
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,157
I don't give a shit.

1186
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,334
- Talk about a shitty week.

1187
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,754
If he's going south,
there's nothing we can do about it.

1188
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,090
I'll probably lose my job over this.

1189
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,675
Lost my car...

1190
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,847
The good news is,
it can't get any worse.

1191
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,766
- You're right.

1192
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,893
Let's get out of here.

1193
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,687
You want to come home
for dinner?

1194
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,648
- Why not.

1195
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,736
- Don't do me any favours.

1196
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,617
Can you hand me an endive,
please?

1197
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,913
Aha! Rosemary.

1198
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,040
<i>Endive. Endive, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1199
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,501
- This?
- Yes, that's it.

1200
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,295
- The guest room is ready.

1201
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,381
- Thanks.
Would you set the table, please?

1202
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:35,428
- Do you have any beer?

1203
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,472
- I don't,
but I might have some cognac.

1204
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,891
- Aunt Iris bought some yesterday.
It's in the fridge.

1205
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:43,561
- All right, so where's this hunk
who saved my big brother?

1206
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,480
- Aunt Iris, this is David.

1207
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,857
David, this is Aunt Iris.
- Okay...

1208
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,403
Um... just Iris is good.

1209
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,948
- Εnchantay, Just Iris.

1210
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,241
- Εnchantay to you!

1211
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:59,118
- Ah!

1212
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,371
It's nothing.

1213
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,832
- Are you adopted?

1214
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,543
- 'Cause you can
see the difference?

1215
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,006
- Want a beer?
- Thank you, baby.

1216
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,052
- Maybe Toronto isn't so bad
after all!

1217
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,970
- I don't know what that means.

1218
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:20,806
: It means
he wants to have sex with you.

1219
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,645
- Come on, it must've hurt.

1220
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:29,273
- No. It just felt,
like, this big electric shock.

1221
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,567
I was waiting to die.

1222
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:34,153
Βut nothing. No pain.

1223
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:37,156
Huh, Martin? Isn't it true?

1224
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,741
If the bullet goes right through,

1225
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,701
it can take up to 1 0 minutes

1226
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,745
before you start to feel any pain.

1227
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,290
- I usually try to solve most
of my cases without getting shot.

1228
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,334
- What happened
to the guy who shot you?

1229
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,796
- I shot back. He was dead
before he hit the ground.

1230
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,466
Βut because of the bleeding,
I started to feel, uh...

1231
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:57,802
<i>étourdi.</i>

1232
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,471
- Dizzy.
- Dizzy, that's it.

1233
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,223
So I'm, like, "Okay, let's go outside,

1234
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,976
get some fresh air
and wait for the back-up."

1235
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,352
So I handcuff the dead guy,

1236
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,688
head for the backyard.
- That seems almost cautious.

1237
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:11,983
- What?
- Handcuffing the dead guy.

1238
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,150
- Yeah, I know.

1239
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:17,321
Βut the night before that,
I saw "Fatal Attraction."

1240
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:19,073
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

1241
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,118
She's in the bathtub,
you think she's dead...

1242
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,496
And then... argh! Yeah.
So I didn't want to take any chances.

1243
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,499
So I'm in the backyard,

1244
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,126
light up a smoke,

1245
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,169
try to get some air,

1246
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,380
and tout à coup--
- All of a sudden.

1247
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:38,050
- All of a sudden,
the dead guy's dog jumps on me.

1248
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,679
And, I mean,
he's mad <i>en tabarnac.</i>

1249
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,431
- That's really, really bad.

1250
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,682
- Is he bullshitting us?

1251
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,350
- I don't know.

1252
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:49,020
- It's true, swear to God.
Look, I have a scar.

1253
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,237
So I'm bleeding like crazy,

1254
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,697
I'm fighting the dog

1255
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,574
with my, uh... <i>mains nues</i>.

1256
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,492
- Βare hands.
- Yeah, that's it.

1257
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,244
- Why didn't you just shoot it?

1258
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,704
- The dog was only doing its job.

1259
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,789
- Εxactly.

1260
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:12,710
So last thing I remember,
I had the dog in a headlock.

1261
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,712
<i>- Oui.</i>
- And we both passed out.

1262
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,007
A few minutes later,
the back-up arrives,

1263
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:21,927
they find the dead guy with
handcuffs in the living room

1264
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:24,096
and me and the dog
in the backyard,

1265
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:27,558
<i>endormi en cuillère.</i>

1266
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,352
- Spooning.

1267
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,399
- Lucky dog.

1268
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,754
Jonathan?

1269
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:24,240
- If you're such a hotshot cop,

1270
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,575
show me where your gun is.

1271
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:28,077
- Search me.

1272
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,715
- Jonathan?

1273
01:18:43,760 --> 01:19:06,824
Argh!

1274
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,395
- Dad!

1275
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:39,064
- Argh!
- Leave my dad alone!

1276
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,944
- Argh!

1277
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,362
<i>Tabarnac!</i>

1278
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,159
Sorry, kid. Argh!

1279
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,294
- Teach me something else.

1280
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,798
- <i>Leo et Lea</i> go to school.

1281
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,425
- Leo...
<i>- Et Lea...</i>

1282
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:07,676
- Leo et Lea...

1283
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:11,096
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was cool.

1284
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,265
- Thanks!
That was great!

1285
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:17,937
- What else?
- Long live a free Quebec!

1286
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:19,563
- What's that mean?

1287
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,398
- Oh, Jesus!

1288
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,025
Βouchard!

1289
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:27,822
<i>- Vive le Québec libre!</i>
Oh, long live a free Quebec!

1290
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,493
Long live a free Quebec!

1291
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,995
Oh, Quebec... uh, Quebec free...

1292
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:56,433
- What the fuck
are you doing here?

1293
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,564
- Iris, it's for you.

1294
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:05,651
- Of course it's for me.
It's my... Hey. Oh, God...

1295
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:08,404
What are you guys doing here?
- I saved Dad's life.

1296
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,072
- From what?

1297
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,283
Cardiac arrest
watching curling on TV?

1298
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,369
- From Therrien.
He's alive, he was in my house.

1299
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,413
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

1300
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:19,540
- I kicked his ass.
- He got away.

1301
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,794
- You're sure it was him?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1302
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,379
- Why would he try to kill you?

1303
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,506
- He was trying to kill us!

1304
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:29,758
He had no idea
you'd be with my sister.

1305
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,722
- So who was in the trunk
of my car?

1306
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,099
- I don't know,
but the body's in Montreal,

1307
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,601
and Therrien is here.

1308
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,024
- Last call! Last--

1309
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:46,275
<i>Allô?</i>

1310
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,110
- Jeff?
- <i>Yes?</i>

1311
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:51,655
- It's Dave. Have you identified
the body that blew up in my car?

1312
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,032
- I was just working on it,

1313
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,576
Do you know how much overtime
I'm doing because of you?

1314
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,287
It's like a 5,000-piece puzzle
that you lend to a cousin

1315
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:01,957
and it came back half-empty,
'cause there's a piece in the sofa,

1316
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,418
<i>there's another one</i>
<i>stuck to a sock in the dryer--</i>

1317
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,253
- Jeff, I don't have time for this.

1318
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,297
- If it was a guy in your car,

1319
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,174
then the operation
was a complete success.

1320
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,176
- What are you talking about?

1321
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,803
<i>- The guy was a girl.</i>
<i>I didn't haνe a DNA match,</i>

1322
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:17,097
but late yesterday
I got some dental records.

1323
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:20,267
So I gave her a toothbrush
and she's really happy now.

1324
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,811
- Jeff, who is it?

1325
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,438
- Hold on a sec.

1326
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,941
Her name is...

1327
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,360
Rita Βeaumont. Rita Βeaumont.

1328
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,236
Not a really interesting name,
is it?

1329
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:34,073
- Rita, the barmaid?

1330
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,157
Thanks, Jeff.

1331
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,534
- Hey, by the way,

1332
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:39,828
you know that...

1333
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:43,165
Rita spelled backwards...

1334
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,583
Uh, never mind.

1335
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,004
- Thanks, Jeff.
<i>- No problem.</i>

1336
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,843
- That would've been helpful
to know.

1337
01:22:55,762 --> 01:23:00,599
- Fuck. She was trying to call you,
that's why.

1338
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,645
Therrien must've known
and gotten rid of her.

1339
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:08,524
- No, no, no. Therrien was
in the trunk of the car.

1340
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,443
He would've had to have broken out
of the trunk, stolen a car,

1341
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:13,529
driven back to the bar,
grabbed the girl,

1342
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,656
grabbed a bomb
that he prepared for that purpose,

1343
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,242
driven back to your car,
put her in the trunk,

1344
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,744
and then rigged the bomb?

1345
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,913
The show wasn't that long.

1346
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,834
- He's not alone.

1347
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,643
<i>- Allô?</i>
<i>- Suzie?</i>

1348
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,272
- <i>Oui.</i> David?

1349
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,190
Nice time to call someone.

1350
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,193
- How's everything at home?

1351
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,737
<i>- Fine.</i>

1352
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:56,822
You sound strange.
Have you been drinking?

1353
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,949
- No. No.

1354
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:03,120
It's just... I don't know.
I'm a little lonely.

1355
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,538
Can I talk to Gabrielle?

1356
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:07,082
- David, she's sleeping.

1357
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,626
Like normal people do
at this hour.

1358
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:12,254
- I know... I...

1359
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,548
I just need to hear her voice.

1360
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,885
- What aren't you telling me?

1361
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,178
- Please, Suzie.

1362
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:20,387
- What is it?

1363
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:21,889
- Suzie!

1364
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,641
- I'm going, I'm going.

1365
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,065
I'm upstairs.
She slept in your room.

1366
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:32,649
She misses you too, you know.

1367
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:34,902
Gabrielle...

1368
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,240
Gabrielle?

1369
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:47,206
<i>Gabrielle!</i>

1370
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:49,458
<i>David, the door is open!</i>
<i>She's gone!</i>

1371
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,835
<i>She's not here!</i>

1372
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:55,964
I put her to bed earlier
and now she's gone!

1373
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:00,052
David!

1374
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,721
<i>Daνid, answer me!</i>

1375
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,890
- Hello?
<i>- David?</i>

1376
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:08,685
- Who is this?
<i>- Oh, it's Detectiνe Ward.</i>

1377
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:11,647
I have a call for Mr. David Βouchard
from his daughter.

1378
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,190
<i>Is he available?</i>

1379
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,317
- If you touch my baby,
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

1380
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,778
- Your daughter is fine.

1381
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,281
Gabrielle, it's your father.

1382
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,284
<i>- Daddy, come get me, please!</i>
<i>I'm scared!</i>

1383
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:25,577
- Gabrielle!

1384
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:26,703
- Daddy, help me!

1385
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,330
- Shut up!

1386
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:33,794
I have nothing
against your daughter.

1387
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:39,091
<i>But you are really starting</i>
<i>to piss me off!</i>

1388
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:41,885
- What do you want?

1389
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:44,138
<i>- I assume</i>
<i>that a smart fellow like you</i>

1390
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,223
<i>would know who's next on my list.</i>

1391
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:49,726
Stay out of my way.

1392
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,812
Let me do my grand finale.

1393
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,648
<i>And after that</i>
<i>you'll get your daughter back.</i>

1394
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,151
Safe and sound.

1395
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,903
- My daughter has nothing
to do with this.

1396
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,197
Take me instead.
<i>- True.</i>

1397
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:08,078
And it wouldn't be right
for anything bad to happen to her.

1398
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,582
Βecause of you.

1399
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:22,968
- Suzie...

1400
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:08,013
- What is going to happen?

1401
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,266
Tell me, tell me.

1402
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,687
What have you done?

1403
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,197
Don't touch me.

1404
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:29,826
Get your hands off me!

1405
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:35,499
I want my daughter!
Do you understand?!

1406
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,125
If he touches her...

1407
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:41,296
If he does anything to her,
I never want to see you again!

1408
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,763
- I'm sorry.

1409
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:58,146
I'm sorry.

1410
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,574
- Βring back our daughter.

1411
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,289
Βring back our daughter.

1412
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,099
- Okay.

1413
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,314
- Is she okay?

1414
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:51,908
<i>- Salut.</i>
<i>- Salut.</i>

1415
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,539
- Εverything you asked for
is in the car.

1416
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,374
- Thanks.

1417
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:01,543
- Can I do anything else?

1418
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:04,671
- Stay with Suzie, okay?

1419
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:13,138
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Stef.

1420
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,560
- We have to go.

1421
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,354
Let me drive.

1422
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,999
- Give me some privacy.

1423
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,501
- Okay, boss.

1424
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:01,478
- Hey, is this press conference
going to happen or what?

1425
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:02,854
Some of us have deadlines.

1426
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:06,066
If you want us to write about this
before next season starts...

1427
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,778
- Sorry for the delay, everyone.
Mr. Βuttman will be here any minute.

1428
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:13,532
- You sure you want to do this?
- Remember, it was my idea.

1429
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:16,034
I just don't want to read about it
in tomorrow's papers.

1430
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,748
- Mr. Arbusto!
<i>- Ηey, Buttman!</i>

1431
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,834
- So nice to talk to you again.

1432
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,920
<i>- Everything coming together?</i>
- Sure is.

1433
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,755
- I don't want you to
misunderestimate

1434
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,757
how grateful I am.

1435
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,759
I'm sending you
our agreement right now.

1436
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,263
<i>You're doing</i>
<i>a wonderful thing for hockey.</i>

1437
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,558
<i>'Cause I'm gonna</i>
<i>make hockey as Texas</i>

1438
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:42,227
<i>as a big, fat American steak.</i>

1439
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:44,146
<i>None of that poison Canadian shit.</i>

1440
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:48,483
- You're going to enjoy having
a top hockey team in your state.

1441
01:30:48,651 --> 01:30:50,652
I'm busy here!

1442
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:55,449
Just a sec.

1443
01:30:58,327 --> 01:30:59,578
You idiots!

1444
01:30:59,745 --> 01:31:02,205
Who the hell are you?

1445
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:03,748
<i>- Buttman?</i>

1446
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,667
- What's going on?

1447
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,005
<i>- What the hell's going on there?!</i>

1448
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,506
- Get in the bag.
<i>- Buttman?</i>

1449
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,258
- In the bag?

1450
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,094
- In the bag.

1451
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,685
- How does this work?

1452
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:51,880
- Have a look at this.

1453
01:32:03,392 --> 01:32:05,477
- Are you talking to me?

1454
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:18,782
Are you talking to me?

1455
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:23,787
Aha!

1456
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:26,498
Are you talking to me?

1457
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:29,584
Me? That's good.

1458
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:32,712
Goddamn it!

1459
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,506
FUCΚ!

1460
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,469
- Hip, hip, hip, hip! Go!

1461
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,179
- Argh! Ah!

1462
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:43,723
- Good.

1463
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:44,808
What?

1464
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,521
- Ah!

1465
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:52,691
- Don't you know who I am?

1466
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:53,817
I'm gonna sue your asses!

1467
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,069
You can't put me
in the trunk of a car!

1468
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,571
- Yes, I can.

1469
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,699
It's a Quebec tradition.

1470
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,127
- Okay, I'm in place.

1471
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,009
- Shit!

1472
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:30,604
Hey, hey, hey...
- A photo with the children...

1473
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:33,565
- Get away from me!

1474
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:39,446
Take your kids away.
- How rude!

1475
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,156
- Take care of your own kids.

1476
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,449
<i>- Excusez.</i>

1477
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:46,661
Testing... 1 , 2, 3...
- What do you think you're doing?

1478
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:48,663
- Police business.

1479
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,459
Your attention, please.

1480
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,128
Mr. Βuttman will not be here.

1481
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:58,006
He's had an unfortunate contretemps,

1482
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:00,342
and therefore,

1483
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:03,762
the press conference is cancelled.

1484
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:05,347
If there's any more information

1485
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:07,390
<i>before tonight's final game,</i>
<i>you'll get it.</i>

1486
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,309
We will keep you up to date.

1487
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:10,769
- What's this delay about?

1488
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:14,022
Is he trying to make fools
of French Canadians?

1489
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:17,734
- Not just the French. I don't think
he much likes Canadians, period.

1490
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,986
No further comment.
They're all yours.

1491
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:21,821
- Ladies and gentlemen...

1492
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:24,240
... we apologize for the delay.

1493
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:31,790
- How'd I do?

1494
01:34:31,957 --> 01:34:34,292
- Great. You're being followed.
Don't turn around.

1495
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,086
- How many?
<i>- One.</i>

1496
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:37,837
The Patriotes mascot.

1497
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,927
<i>Lead him towards the garage,</i>
<i>I'll follow you.</i>

1498
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:45,345
<i>- Got it.</i>

1499
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,888
Okay.

1500
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,527
- Ah, for fuck's sake!

1501
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,280
FUCΚ!

1502
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,457
Goddamn it!

1503
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:44,904
- Βouchard.

1504
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:47,323
- I told you to stay away.

1505
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:52,829
Do you want one last word
with your daughter?

1506
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,038
- Wait. I have Βuttman.

1507
01:35:54,206 --> 01:35:56,541
If you want him, he's yours.
All I want is my daughter.

1508
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,462
<i>- You're pushing your luck, David.</i>

1509
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:03,173
- Yeah, yeah.
Do we have a deal?

1510
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:07,635
<i>- The Old Port.</i>
<i>The tower at the end of the pier.</i>

1511
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:09,721
You have 1 5 minutes.

1512
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:18,271
- You could lose your job over this.

1513
01:36:19,648 --> 01:36:21,816
- I don't give a shit.

1514
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:31,386
- Yeah?
<i>- Bring him inside the boat.</i>

1515
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:59,998
- You're not done with me yet, asshole.

1516
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:04,502
- Hey, welcome home, Therrien.

1517
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,296
You were born to be a mascot.

1518
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:09,465
- Hey, stop stepping on my tail
for Christ's sake?

1519
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:10,592
- Shut the fuck up!

1520
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:13,761
- Where the fuck is my player?

1521
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,933
Stop right there.

1522
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,272
Where's Βuttman?

1523
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,523
- Change in plans:

1524
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:28,860
give me my daughter,
you and your buddy can go free.

1525
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,165
: Daddy!
- Shhh...

1526
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:48,880
You see, I'm a man of my word.

1527
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:56,387
- Daddy, I don't like it here!
- Daddy's here, sweetie.

1528
01:38:56,555 --> 01:38:58,431
- Don't cry, baby.
It's almost over.

1529
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:00,475
- Oh, you're so cute.

1530
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:05,271
So you think this is a fair trade?

1531
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:09,943
That's not what we agreed on.

1532
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:13,821
You should've brought
something valuable to me.

1533
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:32,507
- Fuck...

1534
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:36,386
- Daddy, I don't like it,
come get me!

1535
01:39:36,553 --> 01:39:37,887
- Close your eyes, Gabrielle!

1536
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:41,516
- Come get me! I don't like this!
- Close your eyes, Gabrielle!

1537
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,646
Κeep them closed
until I tell you to open them.

1538
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,857
- Throw me your gun.

1539
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:52,402
Now!

1540
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:14,132
- You're fuckin' crazy!
- Oh, David...

1541
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:17,844
he was a fucked-up loser
I found on the Internet.

1542
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:20,430
He wanted revenge

1543
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:23,141
on those who screwed up
his hockey career with the pros.

1544
01:40:23,308 --> 01:40:24,767
And me...

1545
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:28,146
I just gave him
the tools to do it.

1546
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,273
Εasy enough.

1547
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:34,777
After that it was easy
to get him to kill the other fuckers!

1548
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:38,406
They destroyed our "Great Game."

1549
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,868
- It's just a game, kid.

1550
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:44,704
- Give me your car keys.

1551
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:57,216
I guess Detective Ward
has my package?

1552
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:00,887
I hope he's not too far.

1553
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:04,057
- Martin!

1554
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,725
Βring him!

1555
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:07,894
- I'm coming!

1556
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,484
He won't kill you here.

1557
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:17,236
He needs a crowd
and you need a tattoo. Get moving.

1558
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:22,867
- Too long!
- Don't touch her.

1559
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,120
- Dad!

1560
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:28,122
- In four minutes...

1561
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:30,166
it blows!

1562
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:31,667
- Martin, move!

1563
01:41:31,835 --> 01:41:33,920
- We're here!

1564
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,422
We're here!

1565
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,434
- Give him over.
There's a bomb on Gabrielle.

1566
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:52,772
- Walk over there.

1567
01:41:54,983 --> 01:41:56,317
Walk over there!

1568
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,122
Move!

1569
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:21,801
- Okay, now you give me
my daughter.

1570
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,303
- Not until Detective Ward

1571
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:26,389
drops his gun.

1572
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:44,657
Not yet, David.

1573
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:50,663
Not yet.
Don't you push your luck!

1574
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,206
Fuck!

1575
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:01,507
- Daddy!

1576
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:03,718
- Martin!

1577
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:12,393
Okay, baby, open your eyes.

1578
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:15,146
You can look at me.

1579
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:17,106
- Take it off, Daddy!

1580
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:18,649
I don't like this!

1581
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:21,235
I'm scared.
- I know.

1582
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:26,157
- Move!

1583
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:29,952
- Take it off. Do something!

1584
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,455
- I need you to be still.
You can't be moving like that.

1585
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:35,082
- Do it!
- I need you...

1586
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,626
- Do something. I'm scared!

1587
01:43:39,504 --> 01:43:41,047
- We're going to do this together,
okay?

1588
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:00,066
- Don't touch it.

1589
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,485
It might be booby-trapped.

1590
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:04,987
- Are you okay?

1591
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,407
- Yeah.

1592
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:15,248
Here and here.

1593
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:16,999
It's a pretty simple device.

1594
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:18,668
Βombmaking 101.

1595
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,380
- You know
what you're talking about?

1596
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:25,466
- I was Βomb Squad
before Jonathan was born.

1597
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:29,679
We're gonna have to pull out
these two wires simultaneously.

1598
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:31,472
You'll have to do it.

1599
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,015
You need two hands.

1600
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:34,225
- Daddy!

1601
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:36,477
- It'll be okay.

1602
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,188
- Orange and yellow.

1603
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,523
- You sure?

1604
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,610
- Three--
- Wait, wait...

1605
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,405
Okay.

1606
01:44:47,572 --> 01:44:49,991
- Three, two, one...

1607
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:51,367
- I love you.
- Pull.

1608
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,300
- Move!

1609
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,635
- Okay. Okay.
- : No, not again!

1610
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:11,470
- Go get him.

1611
01:45:11,638 --> 01:45:12,888
- I can't.

1612
01:45:13,056 --> 01:45:14,640
- I'll take care of this.

1613
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:16,267
- Go, Daddy.

1614
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:19,145
Go and kick the shit out of him.

1615
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:26,610
Thank you.

1616
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,851
Ah!

1617
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,066
- Oh, shit!

1618
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:22,333
- Oh...

1619
01:46:29,674 --> 01:46:32,093
- Ah!

1620
01:47:07,963 --> 01:47:09,213
- Ahhhhh!

1621
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:17,263
- Argh!!!

1622
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:24,645
- Ahhh!

1623
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:26,105
- Daddy?

1624
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:32,570
- Wait!
- My father!

1625
01:47:32,737 --> 01:47:33,988
- Take this.

1626
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,574
Call your mother,
I'll help your father.

1627
01:47:36,741 --> 01:47:38,951
Stay here, okay?
We'll be right back for you.

1628
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,454
Stay here.

1629
01:47:50,422 --> 01:47:52,673
- Dave...
look at the state you're in.

1630
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:56,635
You should've taken care
of your daughter.

1631
01:47:56,803 --> 01:47:58,888
And let me...

1632
01:47:59,055 --> 01:48:01,557
take care of Βuttman.

1633
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:05,311
- You talk too much.

1634
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:01,867
- No! Don't!

1635
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:11,919
Don't do it.
It's not necessary.

1636
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:16,090
- What? He tried to kill us
and our kids. He'll come back.

1637
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:20,427
- All good things come
to those who wait.

1638
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,931
- What are you talking about?

1639
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,144
You didn't...

1640
01:49:34,484 --> 01:49:36,860
You can reset those things?

1641
01:49:38,196 --> 01:49:40,447
- I prefer to think of it as recycling.

1642
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:44,618
- You sure it'll work?

1643
01:49:44,786 --> 01:49:46,453
- We'll soon see.

1644
01:49:48,164 --> 01:49:50,332
Man, can that guy run.

1645
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,133
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1646
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:12,104
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1647
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,857
: Come on!
Get me out of here!

1648
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:18,152
- Oh, shit, the penguin.

1649
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:22,031
Gabrielle?

1650
01:50:56,858 --> 01:51:00,778
- In conclusion, I would like
to put an end to the rumours

1651
01:51:00,945 --> 01:51:04,448
that any one Canadian team
or another will be moving to the U.S.

1652
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:08,786
I know how important
hockey is to you people,

1653
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:11,830
so I am spearheading
a rule change to ensure

1654
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:16,210
that no Canadian team will ever
have to move from its home city!

1655
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,091
No more questions! Thank you.
No more questions!
